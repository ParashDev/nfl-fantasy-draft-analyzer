# NFL Fantasy Draft Analyzer

Data-driven fantasy football draft recommendations built from 2025 NFL season data, supporting both completed-season analysis and live in-season updates.

## The Question

I wanted to build a system that takes the guesswork out of fantasy football drafts. Instead of relying on "expert" rankings that change weekly, I wanted raw stats to drive the recommendations: who actually performed, how consistently, and where the real value lies in a 12-team snake draft.

## Project Structure

```
nfl-fantasy-draft-analyzer/
  scripts/
    config.py                  # Season, scoring, draft format settings
    01_clean.py                # Download + clean NFL stats via nfl_data_py
    02_transform.py            # Calculate fantasy points, rank players, build JSON
    03_fetch_adp.py            # Optional: fetch ADP data from Sleeper API
  data/
    raw/                       # Cached raw downloads (git-ignored)
    cleaned/                   # Cleaned CSVs (git-ignored)
    dashboard_data.json        # Dashboard input (generated by 02_transform.py)
  docs/
    cleaning-log.md            # Every cleaning decision documented
    pipeline.md                # Architecture and script documentation
  index.html                   # Single-file dashboard (Tailwind + Chart.js)
  requirements.txt             # Python dependencies
  README.md                    # This file
```

## How to Run

Prerequisites: Python 3.11+, pip

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd nfl-fantasy-draft-analyzer
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/01_clean.py
python scripts/02_transform.py
python -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

Optional enrichment (ADP data from Sleeper API):

```bash
python scripts/03_fetch_adp.py
python scripts/02_transform.py   # Rerun to incorporate ADP data
```

## Switching to Live Mode (Next Season)

When the 2026 NFL season starts:

1. Edit `scripts/config.py`: set `SEASON_YEAR = 2026` and `MODE = "live"`
2. Rerun the pipeline -- scripts will download the latest available data
3. Dashboard automatically shows "LIVE" badge and "through Week X" labels
4. Rerun weekly to get updated recommendations

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push to GitHub
2. Settings > Pages > Source: main branch, / (root)
3. Site is live at `https://<username>.github.io/nfl-fantasy-draft-analyzer`

## What This Demonstrates

| Skill | How |
|---|---|
| Data Cleansing | Normalizing nfl_data_py output across seasonal and weekly granularities, handling missing stats for multi-position players |
| ETL Pipeline | Config-driven scripts with static/live mode switching, optional enrichment with graceful degradation |
| Fantasy Analytics | Custom scoring calculations (Standard, Half PPR, Full PPR), consistency metrics from weekly variance, positional scarcity modeling |
| Visualization | Interactive Chart.js dashboard with position filtering, conditional ADP comparison, responsive design |
| Documentation | Cleaning decision log, pipeline architecture docs, deployment instructions |

## Data Sources

| Source | Format | What It Provides |
|---|---|---|
| nflverse (via nfl_data_py) | CSV/DataFrame | Seasonal stats, weekly stats, roster data for all NFL players |
| Sleeper API | JSON | Player metadata, ADP estimates, injury status (optional enrichment) |

## Scoring Formats Supported

- **Standard**: No points for receptions
- **Half PPR**: 0.5 points per reception
- **Full PPR**: 1 point per reception

Default analysis uses Half PPR (most common league format).
